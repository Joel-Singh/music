# Joel's Music Repository

My personal music repository. `music.txt` are lines of
directory paths and youtube music links. `download-music.fish`
reads `music.txt` and downloads all music with `yt-dlp` in
`./downloaded-music`.

## Dependencies

- Fish Shell
- yt-dlp

Why the fish shell and not just bash? I thought it'd be fun to learn.
